<h2>Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters</h2>
Following is the explanation of asset configuration parameters.

    <b>User with access to the Firepower node: </b>Username of the user with access to the Firepower node.

<h2>Authentication</h2>
The app uses token-based authentication. The 'test connectivity' action fetches a new token in exchange for the provided username and password. The app uses this token for authentication. The newly fetched token is encrypted and stored in the state file for future use. If the stored token expires or gets corrupted, the app automatically generates a new one.

<h2>Port Information</h2>
<p>
  The app uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol for communicating with the Cisco Firepower Server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
